Cron is a command line program which schedules jobs on a unixoid system. Cronjobs are often used for
periodic tasks like down- and uploading data or for system maintenance tasks. The actions cron
performes are configured in a crontab file, which can be user specific or globally contributed for the
system (mostly to find in /etc directory). It follows a specific syntax of setting the interval and
afterwards specifying the task to perform.
