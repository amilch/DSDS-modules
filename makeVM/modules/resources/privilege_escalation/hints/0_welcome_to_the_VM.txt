Oh damn. Welcome to this VM. You’ve been administrator of this machine, but somehow it got hacked.
There is a program running, encrypting your precious cat pictures in /usr/share/cat_pictures_archive/
but you forgot to backup them. You have access to your personal user account, mario with the password
Its4321?! 
But the root user's password was changed. Currently there is no action by the intruder, so
it’s your moment! 
Try to escalate your privileges on this machine to get root access to the machine and stop the
encryption of the pictures. 
If you need some help, check the hints in this folder. They point to specific technologies and
elements of this system and may help you find the right attacking vectors. If you’re still
struggeling, there is a walkthrough which describes each step and provides the needed scripts and
commands. 
You don’t have to, but it might be useful to use a Kali-Linux VM, it provides some useful tools for
this challenge.
