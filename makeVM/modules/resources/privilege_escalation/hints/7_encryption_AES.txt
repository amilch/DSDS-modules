The Advanced Encryption Standard (short AES) are a family of symmetric key algorithms based on a
common encryption and differing key and blocklengths. AES is based on a substitution-permutation
network. This means that a series of linked mathematical operation is performed to encrypt the
original text. Therefore the algorithm splits the plaintext into chunks and encrypts each chunck
with alternating rounds of substitutions and permutation. Therefore substitution boxes (S-boxes)
and permutation boxes (P-boxes) are created. One single box is easy to compute on soft- or
hardware and produces only small cryptographic strength. Through the combination of both box
types and the constant usage of the key the encryption reaches a high level of security. These
days AES is proclaimed to be save, when correctly implemented.
