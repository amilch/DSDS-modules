Tar is a utility for creating and packing files into an archive. It is mostly used for backups or
software distribution. The name ‘tar’, short for ‘taped archive’ , points back to the time when data
was saved on magnetic tapes. During the years the tar program became more complex and offers different
types for the storage of the data. A tar archive serializes the objects and adds a 512 byte long
header with additional metadata generated from the file.
